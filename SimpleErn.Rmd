Simple urn simulation with R: There is an urn with 2 black balls (B), 3 white balls (W),
and 3 red balls (R). We draw all of these 8 balls sequentially.
(a) What is the probability of observing B first and W last when we draw without
replacement. The sequence between the first B and the last W does not matter.
Calculate the probability by simulation.
(b) What is the probability of observing B first and W last when we draw with replacement.
The sequence between the first B and the last W does not matter.
Calculate the probability by simulation.
```{r}

#This line creates a vector simple_urn representing the composition of the urn. There are two balls of type 1, three of type 2, and three of type 3.

simple_urn <- c(rep(1, 2), rep(2, 3), rep(3, 3))

#'n_trial' is the number of trials to be conducted in the simulation. In this case, it's set to 10,000.

n_trial <- 10^4

#Two matrices (w_replacement and wo_replacement) are initialized to store the results of the urn experiments.

w_replacement <- matrix(NA, nrow = n_trial, ncol = length(simple_urn))
wo_replacement <- matrix(NA, nrow = n_trial, ncol = length(simple_urn))

#In each iteration, a random sample of balls is drawn with and without replacement and stored in the matrices.

for (i in 1:n_trial) {
  w_replacement[i,] <- sample(simple_urn, length(simple_urn), replace = TRUE)
  wo_replacement[i,] <- sample(simple_urn, length(simple_urn), replace = FALSE)
}

#'success_fun' is a function that takes a sequence of drawn balls and checks if black ball is drawn first and white ball is drawn last. The count is incremented if the condition is met.

success_fun <- function(x){
  target_seq <- c(1,2)
  count <- 0
  if (x[1] == target_seq[1] && x[length(x)] == target_seq[2]) {
    count <- count + 1
  }
  
  return(count)
}

#The apply function is used to apply the success_fun to each row of the matrices, resulting in vectors w_replacement_result and wo_replacement_result containing the count of successful events for each trial.

w_replacement_result <- apply(w_replacement, 1, function(x) success_fun(x))
wo_replacement_result <- apply(wo_replacement, 1, function(x) success_fun(x))

#The probabilities of success are calculated and printed. The probability is calculated as the ratio of the number of successful events to the total number of trials.

cat("The probability without replacement", 
    (length(wo_replacement_result) - sum(wo_replacement_result == 0))/
      length(wo_replacement_result), "\n")

cat("The probability with replacement", (length(w_replacement_result) - sum(w_replacement_result == 0))/
      length(w_replacement_result), "\n")
